# Event++ - Minimal C++ message system

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skypjack/eventpp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skypjack/eventpp)

## Note

This project is no longer maintained.<br/>
The event handler and much more has conveyed in
[`EnTT`](https://github.com/skypjack/entt), another project of mine.<br/>
Please, refer to the [official documentation](https://skypjack.github.io/entt/)
for more details.

Feel free to keep using `Event++` if you want, but do not expect support or
new functionalities in future.<br/>
Otherwise, try to give a chance to [`EnTT`](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)
and you'll see it will not disappoint you.

## Synopsis

Minimal C++ message system aimed to work as an event bus for the application.

This class is not meant as a drop-in replacement for the `std::function`. That is
not the purpose of these classes nor the expectation is to get better
performance.<br/>
This is meant as an *event bus*, nothing more.

## Code Example

Here is an example of use:

```cpp
using namespace eventpp;

struct EventA: public Event<EventA> { EventA(int) { } };
struct EventB: public Event<EventB> { };
struct EventC: public Event<EventC> { };

void fn(const EventB &) { }

struct MyListener
{
    void receive(const EventA &) { }
    void listen(const EventB &) { }
    void receive(const EventC &) { }
};

using MyBus = Bus<EventA, EventB, EventC>;

// ...

std::shared_ptr<MyListener> listener = std::make_shared<MyListener>();
MyBus bus{};

// ...

// member methods named receive are automatically attached to the bus
bus.reg(listener);

// all the other member methods can be easily attached too
bus.add<EventB, MyListener, &MyListener::listen>(listener);

// also, member methods named receive can be added or removed as it follows
bus.remove<EventA>(listener);
bus.add<EventA>(listener);

// functions are accepted citizens as well
bus.add<EventB, fn>();
bus.remove<EventB, fn>();

// finally, events can be emitted with a single command
bus.publish<EventA>(42);
bus.publish<EventB>();
bus.publish<EventC>();
```

And that's all.

## Motivation

Uhm... Well, I was experimenting. What else?<br/>
I needed a minimal *event bus* for my applications, something easy to use and
with a bunch of features like auto disconnection support for the listeners and
auto registration of the member methods.

## Installation

The *eventpp* library is a header only library.<br/>
Because of that, a user is demanded simply to include it and all the
functionalities will be available at once.<br/>
Please, note that all the types are part of the `eventpp` namespace.
