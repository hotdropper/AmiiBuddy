# AmiiBuddy

Initially started from [Wifiibo](https://github.com/Xerxes3rd/Wifiibo),
 but has since been radically changed. It gave me an "arduino ready" copy
 of [amiitool](https://github.com/socram8888/amiitool) to use.

Uses [M5ez](https://github.com/ropg/M5ez) for the user interface.

## General info

Hardware Pieces:
- [M5Stack Faces Pocket Computer](https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/face)
- [Magic21x RFID Tag](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lab401.com/collections/rfid-badges/products/ntag-compatible-21x&sa=D&source=hangouts&ust=1595436891659000&usg=AFQjCNEYJOh9Y4aKpK-neO_60FaWAG1ujA)
- [PN532 RFID Module](https://www.amazon.com/Module-Communication-Arduino-Raspberry-Android/dp/B082498VYD)
- 16 GB SD card (probably need much less, didn't realize how small all of this data really was... heh)

## How to make your own
